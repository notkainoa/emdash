description: Visualize your tasks on a board
---

The Kanban view displays your tasks as cards on a board with three columns. Drag tasks between columns to track their status.

## Columns

- **To-do**: Tasks not yet started
- **In-progress**: Tasks currently running
- **Ready for review**: Completed tasks with changes to review

## Automatic Transitions

Tasks move between columns automatically based on activity:

- When an agent starts working, the task moves to In-progress
- When an agent finishes (terminal exits, changes detected, or PR created), the task moves to Ready for review

You can also drag cards manually to change their status.

## Card Information

Each card shows:

- Task name
- Branch name
- Provider/agent running the task
- Activity spinner when the agent is busy

Hover over a card to see more details: provider list, and a summary of file changes (files changed, lines added/removed).

## Creating Tasks

Click the + button in the To-do column to create a new task. This opens the same task creation modal as the main "Add Task" button.

## Opening a Task

Click any card to open that task's detail view with the terminal and diff panel.
