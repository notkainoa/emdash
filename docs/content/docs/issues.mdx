description: Pass issues from Linear, Jira, or GitHub directly to agents
---

Emdash connects to Linear, Jira, and GitHub Issues. Pass issues from your tracker directly to agents. The issue title, description, and metadata become part of the agent's prompt.

## How It Works

1. Create a new task
2. Click **Advanced Options**
3. Select an issue from the dropdown (searchable by ID, title, or assignee)
4. Start the task

The agent receives the full issue context and begins working immediately.

## Supported Trackers

Emdash supports:

- Linear
- Jira
- GitHub Issues
